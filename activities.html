   <h1>Activities</h1>

   <p>This Island is the perfect base for those who like to explore their surroundings and be at one with nature. We offer one of the widest selections of activities in the country, suiting thrill seekers, foodies, wine connoisseurs, romantics or simply those who love to relax.</p>

   <p>Here are a few ideas to inspire you:</p>

   <h2>Dive In</h2>
   <p>The Island is justifiably famous for the beauty of the underwater world. While our house reef is outstanding, nothing beats a trip to nearby coral reefs. Whether you choose snorkelling hopping or a snorkelling safari, the idea is the same: a local wooden boat, called a dhoni, will take you to some of the more spectacular reefs where you can snorkel to your heart's content.</p>

   <h2>Cast Away</h2>

   <p>If the idea of playing Robinson Crusoe on a picture-perfect island appeals to you, then a deserted island trip is a 'must try'. Hop on board and you're soon dropped off at a deserted island, just the two of you. It's certainly a lot more luxurious than Crusoe's experience, though: a picnic table, chilled drinks and umbrella will be waiting for you. Your man Friday will even give you a mobile phone so you can call for someone to pick you up when you're done swimming, snorkeling, sunbathing and exploring the island. Keep an eye out for dolphins on the way over to the island.</p>

   <h2>Sail Away</h2>
   <p>Charter one of our yachts and simply lose yourself on the horizon of your dreams. Whether your fantasy is to simply cruise around the atoll dropping anchor wherever the snorkeling takes your fancy, or the lure of your own chef setting up a seafood feast on the perfect sandbank or your own private island is more your cup of tea, there's no getting away from it: this is perfection in paradise.</p>
