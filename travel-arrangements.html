  <h2>How do I get to this awsome resort?</h2>
  <p>In high season it really should not be a problem as connections to the Island Resort are available from several cities around the world. Most of the time with multiple departure times throughout the day. In Low Season it is a bit more 'problematic' to reach the Island Resort that easily as for example there will be no direct ferry between the resort and Metropolis during low season. If you are considering departing (straight) from Sin City to travel to the resort you can opt for many flights per day.</p>

  <p> To arrive on the Island Resort on the same day we recommend that you select a flight that departs from any particular destination in Neverland that arrives at the closes island - or Main Airport as early as possible or at least BEFORE 09:00 AM. From what we understood both Superman and Supergirl airlines sell packages that include the actual flight, transportation to the private island all together.</p>

  <uo>
  <li>Book Boat Tickets: They offer tickets to destinations across almost the entire Eternal Sea. You can island hop all the way from Mtropolis to SinCity.</li>
  <li>Book Minibus Tickets: Buy your Minibus Tickets in advance on connecting routes to Metropolis and the private island.</li>
  <li>Book Private Taxis: They also offer Private cars and vans from the private island to the airport.</li>
